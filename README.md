### "Show/Exec" commands
**exec00.py** is a simple script that uses Netmiko to do "show/exec" commands in a single network device.

We do some variations in **exec01.py** and **exec02.py** .

**exec03.py** is the final script that can do "show/exec" for different network vendors.
### Push Configuration
In the same way **config00.py** is a simple script that uses Netmiko to push config in a single network device.

We do some variations in **config01.py** and **config02.py**.

**config03.py** is the final script that can push config for different network vendors.
